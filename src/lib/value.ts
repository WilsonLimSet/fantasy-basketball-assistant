 * How Takeover values a player. Expected fantasy points = chance he plays × minutes × points per
 * minute, summed over the games that matter:
 *  - window: a stretch like "the next 2 days" or "rest of this week". Only whether he plays those
 *    games counts (current injury status), not long-term durability.
 *  - rest of season: durability counts too (games missed last season, age, current injury).
 * Minutes follow recent games (median of the last few, so one blowout doesn't swing it) and flag
 * roles that only exist while an injured teammate is out. Points per minute is split in two:
 * rebounds, assists, steals, blocks and turnovers settle fast, so this season's rate takes over
 * quickly; scoring and shooting swing with luck, so it leans on the projection longer and drives
 * the floor/ceiling spread. Players on bad teams get no penalty: empty stats still count.
