## Key Decisions
| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Position-based + star-based alerts | User wants both: shares minutes/role AND high-usage stars | 2026-01-14 |
| Remove Gemini voice | User explicitly doesn't want, reduces complexity | 2026-01-14 |
| Keep 12hr refresh | Sufficient frequency, avoids rate limits | 2026-01-14 |
| Keep waiver recommendations | User finds value in top adds and streaming | 2026-01-14 |
| Both return scenarios | Alert when your player returns AND when threats return | 2026-01-14 |
| Voice files untracked | Deleted from disk, no git commits needed for Task 1 | 2026-01-14 |
